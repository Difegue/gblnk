Mad Catz Camera Link Communications Protocol

Printer IO Ports:
Base+0: Data Port
Base+1: Status Port
Base+2: Control

Reset Procedure:
1. Output 0x24 to control (tristate data and set control to 0100)
2. Wait for bit 5 of status port to become 1
3. Read lower 4 bits of data port
4. If read data != 4, then go to step 1.
5. (Useless read of control port?)
6. Output 0x22 to control (tristate data and set control to 0010)
7. Wait for bit 5 of status port to become 0 
8. Output 0x26 to control (tristate data and set control to 0110)

Data Read Procedure:
1. Output 0x26 to control (tristate data and set control to 0110)
2. Wait for bit 5 of status port to become 1
3. Read lower 4 bits of data port, store to lower 4 bits of received byte
4. (Useless read of control port?)
5. Output 0x22 to control (tristate data and set control to 0010) 
6. Wait for bit 5 of status port to become 0
7. Output 0x26 to control (tristate data and set control to 0110)
8. Wait for bit 5 of status port to become 1
9. Read lower 4 bits of data port, store to upper 4 bits of received byte
10. (Useless read of control port?)
11. Output 0x22 to control (tristate data and set control to 0010) 
12. Wait for bit 5 of status port to become 0
13. Go to step 1
