Hey there!

Firstly, this program depends on the allegro library.
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/

It was compile with the 4.0 version on my machine.

My friend had a spare gameboy camera and a link cable from the MadCatz company. I couldn't beleive that nobody had
written transfer software for linux. So i wrote some. Here it is. Now I can take crusty, 4 color greyscale, hax0r
pictures and download them onto my computer. Thanks very much to Martin Eyre for telling me the correct algorithm with
which the tiles are encoded. Now the pictures come out exactly as they're shown on the gameboy screen.

The files madcatz.c & madcatz.txt were written by someone else. i included them as credit. I found them here:

There is no indication of the name of the person who wrote these. They appear to be for a dos compiler.

Lemme know what you think of gblnk!
